# Data-Vamp

**Data-Vamp** is a repository documenting my hands-on journey to become a skilled **Data Analyst**.  
Each "Day" represents a step in exploring, analyzing, and deriving insights from real-world datasets.  
Currently, I am working with the **Student Performance dataset** from Kaggle.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my progression in **data analysis**, including:

- Data loading and inspection  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization of key patterns and relationships  
- Correlation and insights for informed interpretation  
- Continuous skill-building over multiple days

**Dataset:** Student Performance (Kaggle)  
**Tools & Libraries:** Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook  
**Goal:** Turn raw data into actionable insights and strengthen my analytics portfolio
